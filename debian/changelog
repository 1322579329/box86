box86 (0.2.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added an option to get generated -NAN on SSE2 operation
  * Many small fixes and improvement to get steam and SteamPlay working (along with box64)
  * Added some workaround for program calling uname to mimic x86 system
  * Added some more Vulkan extensions
  * Added some granularity to mmap64, and generic memory protection tracking improvment, to mimic x86 system (for wine stagging and proton)
  * Better clone syscall and libc implementation
  * Improved wrapping of GTK libs
  * More wrapped libs (more gtk libs, like gstreamer-1.0 among other non-gtk libs too)
  * More wrapped functions(with some tricky one, like dladdr1)
  * Some fixes and improvment to some wrapped functions
