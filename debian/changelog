box86 (0.2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Some work on Dynarec to limit the number of mutex use, and also allow smaller block to be built (for JIT'd programs)
  * Introduce BOX86_DYNAREC_STRONGMEM, like with box64 (not found any program that needs that yet)
  * More vulkan wrapped function (so dkvk works, at least with RX550)
  * Reworked Elfloader part, with better handling of versionned symbols
  * Improve speed for x87 code (by avoiding many float<->double conversion)
  * Improve speed of the custom allocator used by dynarec and Hash (speedup loading)
  * Added a detection of box64 in uname call, to expose an x86_64 system instead of i386 one
  * Added a fix for linking box86 on system using glibc 2.34+
  * A few more wrapped libs
  * More ARM hardware option in CMake (Phytium, SD845)
  * Changed a bit struture of Dynarec, switching some operations from Pass1 to Pass0
  * Small fixes to elfloader
  * Some fixes and improvments on wrapped libs (mainly gtk2, gtk3 and d3dadpter)
  * Better VSyscall implementation
  * Fixed the "Alternate" handling (address shadowing on x86 side)
  * A few opcodes border case fixes
  * Improved wrapper helpers (from rajdakin)
  * Added a mecanism to cancel a Dynarec block construction if it triggers a segfault (instead of a crash)
  * Improvment to the handling of longjmp inside signal handlers
